    abstract = {<p>Detection of rare events happening in a set of DNA/protein sequences could lead to new biological discoveries. One kind of such rare events is the presence of patterns called motifs in DNA/protein sequences. Finding motifs is a challenging problem since the general version of motif search has been proven to be intractable. Motifs discovery is an important problem in biology. For example, it is useful in the detection of transcription factor binding sites and transcriptional regulatory elements that are very crucial in understanding gene function, human disease, drug design, etc. Many versions of the motif search problem have been proposed in the literature. One such is the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0041425.e002" mimetype="image" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula><italic>-motif search</italic> (or <italic>Planted Motif Search (PMS)</italic>). A generalized version of the PMS problem, namely, <italic>Quorum Planted Motif Search (qPMS)</italic>, is shown to accurately model motifs in real data. However, solving the qPMS problem is an extremely difficult task because a special case of it, the PMS Problem, is already NP-hard, which means that any algorithm solving it can be expected to take exponential time in the worse case scenario. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm named qPMS7 that tackles the qPMS problem on real data as well as challenging instances. Experimental results show that our Algorithm qPMS7 is on an average 5 times faster than the state-of-art algorithm. The executable program of Algorithm qPMS7 is freely available on the web at <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pms.engr.uconn.edu/downloads/qPMS7.zip" xlink:type="simple">http://pms.engr.uconn.edu/downloads/qPMS7.zip</ext-link>.

    abstract = {<p>Motif search is a fundamental problem in bioinformatics with an important application in locating transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) in DNA sequences. The exact algorithms can report all (<italic>l</italic>, <italic>d</italic>) motifs and find the best one under a specific objective function. However, it is still a challenging task to identify weak motifs, since either a large amount of memory or execution time is required by current exact algorithms. A new exact algorithm, PairMotif, is proposed for planted (<italic>l</italic>, <italic>d</italic>) motif search (PMS) in this paper. To effectively reduce both candidate motifs and scanned <italic>l</italic>-mers, multiple pairs of <italic>l</italic>-mers with relatively large distances are selected from input sequences to restrict the search space. Comparisons with several recently proposed algorithms show that PairMotif requires less storage space and runs faster on most PMS instances. Particularly, among the algorithms compared, only PairMotif can solve the weak instance (27, 9) within 10 hours. Moreover, the performance of PairMotif is stable over the sequence length, which allows it to identify motifs in longer sequences. For the real biological data, experimental results demonstrate the validity of the proposed algorithm.</p>},

ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND:Given a set of DNA sequences s1, ..., st, the (l, d) motif problem is to find an l-length motif sequence M , not necessary existing in any of the input sequences, such that for each sequence si, 1 [less than or equal to] i [less than or equal to] t, there is at least one subsequence differing with at most d mismatches from M. Many exact algorithms have been developed to solve the motif finding problem in the last three decades. However, the problem is still challenging and its solution is limited to small values of l and d.RESULTS:In this paper we present a new efficient method to improve the performance of the exact algorithms for the motif finding problem. Our method is composed of two main steps: First, we process q [less than or equal to] t sequences to find candidate motifs. Second, the candidate motifs are searched in the remaining sequences. For both steps, we use the best available algorithms. Our method is a hybrid one, because it integrates currently existing algorithms to achieve the best running time. In this paper, we show how the optimal value of q is determined to achieve the best running time. Our experimental results show that there is about 24% speed-up achieved by our method compared to the best existing algorithm. Furthermore, we also present a parallel version of our method running on shared memory architecture. Our experiments show that the performance of our algorithm scales linearly with the number of processors. Using the parallel version, we were able to solve the (21, 8) challenging instance using 8 processors in 20.42 hours instead of 6.68 days of the serial version.CONCLUSIONS:Our method speeds up the solution of the exact motif problem. Our method is generic, because it can accommodate any new faster algorithm based on traditional methods. We expect that our method will help to discover longer motifs. The software we developed is available for free for academic research at http://www.nubios.nileu.edu.eg/tools/hymotif webcite.},
