    abstract    = {We give a randomized algorithm in deterministic
  time O(N log  M) for estimating the score vector of matches between a text
  string of length N and a pattern string of length M, i.e., the vector
  obtained when the pattern is slid along the text, and the number of matches
  is counted for each position. A direct application is approximate string
  matching. The randomized algorithm bases on convolution to find an estimator
  of the scores; the variance of the estimator is particularly small for scores
  that are close to M, i.e., for approximate occurrences of the pattern in
  the text. No assumption is made about the probabilistic characteristics of
  the input, or about the size of the alphabet. The solution extends to string
  matching with classes, class complements, ``never match'' and ``always
  match'' symbols, to the weighted case and to higher dimensions.},
